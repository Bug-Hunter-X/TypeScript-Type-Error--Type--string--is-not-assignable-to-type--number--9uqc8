# TypeScript Type Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and its solution.  The error, 'Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'', arises when a string is passed as an argument to a function expecting a number.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version.

This example highlights TypeScript's strong typing system and the importance of type checking for robust code.
